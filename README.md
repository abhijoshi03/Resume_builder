# Flexiple Assignment

## What was completed?
#### 1. User signup
#### 2. Experience section


## what still needs work?
#### 1. Profile image upload:
This feature currently can accept custom images from the user but can't display it on the overview page as there are some unhandelled errors when a new user signs up.

## what could be improved?
#### 1. custom error messages: 
As of now, custom error validations are not set up. each error can be handeled individually to give the user verboose data on what is going wrong.
#### 2. UI components:
some UI components such as the delete feature can be improved and the logic can be updated to remove A section instantly instead of deleting post edit submission

## what was not completed?
#### 1. Projects section: 
coudn't complete the projects section under the time limit. The time consuming part was to undersand assocation between experience section and project section and how one experience can have multiple projects but each project can only have one experience assocated with it
